 <p><strong>remoteAllureFolder</strong> is needed to set path of device allure-results directory (default is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/sdcard/allure-results</code>, also for empty remoteAllureFolder property).

from which is needed to use parallel transferring (the default is 200)</p>
 <p><strong>startAsyncOtherFilesTransferFrom</strong> is the value of allure other
